HTML5 video format conversion tool

Not yet implemented. Just a set of failing unit tests at the moment.

For successful cross-browser use of HTML5 video you must supply the video in both WebM and MP4 formats. This module will accept a WebM (VP8) or MP4 video, convert it to the other format, and also generate a JPEG thumbnail image as a fallback.
